SCOPE:
JS does not provide block scoping.Everything is function scoping.
eq:


var scope="global";

function f(){
  console.log(scope);
  var scope="local";
  console.log(scope);
}

f();
OUTPUT:
udnefined
local

this is because the gloabl scope variable has been overrridden by the local scope variable.So when we try to print
scope in the first line it does not take the gloabl scope but the local scope which hasn't been assisgned a value yet.
