TWO WAYS OF CREATING A GLOBAL OBJECT:
using var:
You can create a global object using the var keyword.
eg:

var name="akash";
if a variable is declared without the var keyword then JS automaitcally amkes it global!

USING this.

this.name="akash" ---->creates a global object.


difference between var nad this?
using var you create a non deleteable property while using this you can delete the property.
