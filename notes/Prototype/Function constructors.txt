Function constructor-A normal function which is used to create an object.

The this variable points to a new empty object and that object is returned from the
function automatically.

EXAMPLE 1:
function person(first,last){
	console.log(this);
	this.firstname=first;
	this.lastname=last;
	this.getFullName=function(){
		console.log(this.firstname+" "+this.lastname);
	}
	console.log("function is invoked");
}

var k=new person("akash","gupta");
var x=new person("utpal","gupta");
console.log(k);
k.getFullName();
console.log(x);
x.getFullName();



OUTPUT:
person{}
function is invoked
akash gupta



person{}
function is invoked
utpal gupta



PROGRAM FLOW:The new keyword creates an empty object.
As soon as we call the person() function the 'this' keyword will intially
point to the empty object.
We can then use the 'this' keyword to assign properties to the object.
We are therefore creating an object by calling a function.
