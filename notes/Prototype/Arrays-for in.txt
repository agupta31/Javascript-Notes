WHY WE SHOULD NEVER USE FOR IN LOOP TO ITERATE THROUGH ARRAYS:

var arr=[1,'doe',false];
Array.prototype.school="xavier's";

for(var x in arr)
{
	console.log(x+" "+arr[x]);
}
for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
  {
  	console.log(arr[i]);
  }
OUTPUT:
0:1
1:doe
2:false
school:xavier's

0:1
1:doe
2:false

using for in on arrays includes the property in the arrays prototype as well whereas
normal for loop doesn't.So it is a good practice to avoid for in on arrays.
