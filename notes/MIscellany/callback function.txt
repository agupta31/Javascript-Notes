//callbakc function: a function to which you pass a function,to be run when
it finishes.

In other words the function which you invoked 'calls back' the function
which you passed to it as a parameter.



function callMeWhenDone(callback)//so callMeWhenDone is the callback function
{
	var x=23;
	var y=12;
	var sum=x+y;
	console.log(sum);
	callback();
}

callMeWhenDone(function(){
	console.log('you called back.Thanks');
})

callMeWhenDone(function(){
	console.log('you called back again.Thanks a ton');
})

OUTPUT:
35
you called back.Thanks

35
you called back again.Thanks a ton.
