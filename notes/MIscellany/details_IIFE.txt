IIFE:

(function(firstname,lastname,age)
{
   console.log("inside IIFE: "+firstname+" "+lastname+" "+age);
})('akash','gupta',21);

OUTPUT:
inside IIFE: akash gupta 21
In JS parenthesis is used for grouping expression and has the highest precedence.
The parenthesis at the beginning of the function tells the parser that this is
meant to be an expression and not a normal function statement.
We are creating the function and invoking it on the fly.
