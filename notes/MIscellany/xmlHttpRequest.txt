xmlHttpRequest- used to retrieve info from the web server.The info can be a jason,xml,pdf
etc.

Sending a request can be done using two methods:
create a request object:
var reqObj=new xmlHttpRequest();

reqObj.open("GET",url,true/false);
reqObj.send();

GET=type of request.
Get is simpler and faster.However,POST has no size limitation and is more secure.POST is
used when transferring large data.

url-the address of the file on the server.Can be any kind of file-.txt,pdf,xml.

true-when you want JS to behave asynchronously-AJAX implementation.This ensures that
JS is doing other jobs while waiting for the request.Specify a function to execute when
the response is ready in the onreadystatechange event.

false-JS waits until the request is received.This is risky when the server is slow or busy.
In such a case the application will be hung.
