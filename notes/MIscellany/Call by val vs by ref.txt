//call by value

 //call by reference
  var x={

  }
  var m=x;
  x.greeting="ola";

  console.log(x);
  console.log(m);//b changes with a as b points to the same memory as a


  
  //equals operator sets up a new memory space
  x={greeting:"howdy"};//what this does is that it is not mutating the object
                      //x but its creating a new memory altogether which contains
                      //this name -value pair .
  console.log(x);
  console.log(m);//m howver still points to the old memory location so it's value
                  //does not change.

OUTPUT:

 Object {greeting: "hola"}
